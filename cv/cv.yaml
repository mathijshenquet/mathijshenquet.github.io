about:
  full: |
    I take ideas from pitch to production — identifying problems, building solutions, and driving them to adoption.

    At Royal NLR, I consistently bridged the gap from research to operational impact. I pitched and built SKY, a secure generative AI platform for classified data now used organization-wide, delivering €800k+/yr in measured productivity gains. I then led SENTINEL, a NATO-funded voice assistant for military situational awareness, to adoption as a standard capability by the Dutch Ministry of Defence — a milestone reached by only 4% of defense innovation projects.

    My work is grounded in a dual background in CS and mathematics, with work in formal methods and homotopy type theory. My engagement with AI safety began as a 2019 MIRI Fellow and remains central to my interests.
  short: "Engineer with a dual CS/Math background who takes ideas from pitch to production. At NLR, I built and drove adoption of SKY (generative AI platform, €800k+/yr gains) and SENTINEL (military voice assistant, adopted by Dutch MOD). MIRI 2019 Fellow."
