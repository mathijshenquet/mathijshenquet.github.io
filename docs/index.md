# Mathijs Henquet

**Software Engineer** · Amsterdam, NL

Software engineer with a CS and mathematics background. At NLR I pitched, built, and drove adoption of two products: SKY (generative AI platform, €800k+/yr productivity gains) and SENTINEL (voice-driven assistant for military situational awareness, adopted by Dutch MOD). MIRI 2019 summer fellow. Based in Amsterdam.

## About

I combine a dual CS and mathematics background — including deep work in homotopy type theory and formal methods — with the drive to turn ideas into systems people actually use.

At NLR I pitched and built SKY, a generative AI platform for classified data that is now used organization-wide, generating €800k+/yr in measured productivity gains. I pitched and led SENTINEL, a voice-driven assistant for military situational awareness that was adopted as a standard capability by the Dutch Ministry of Defence — in a sector where only 4% of innovation projects reach adoption.

The common thread: I don't just build what's specced. I identify the problem, pitch the solution, build it, and drive it to adoption.

My interests in AI safety and research infrastructure go back to my MIRI fellowship in 2019 and continue to shape the problems I choose to work on.

## Experience

### NLR — Royal Netherlands Aerospace Centre
**R&D Engineer, AI team** · 2023–2026 · Amsterdam

Drove innovation from concept to production. Combining technology scouting, strategic proposal writing, project leadership, and hands-on development.

- **SKY** — Pitched, designed, and built NLR's in-house generative AI platform for sensitive/classified data. Security-compliant, locally hosted. Generates €800k+/yr in measured productivity gains. Proposed spin-off strategy and consortium model for cross-institute adoption.
  *Tech: .NET C#, gRPC, Python, RAG, TensorRT-LLM, Docker, Rust*
- **SENTINEL** — Pitched, led the project team, and was primary developer of a real-time voice-driven assistant for military situational awareness. Combines speech recognition, speech synthesis, and vision-language models into a responsive system for field operators. Adopted as a standard capability by the Dutch Ministry of Defence — one of only 4% of defense innovation projects to reach adoption.
  *Tech: Python, Whisper, WebRTC, vLLM, VLM/LLM, TTS (Kokoro)*
- **Mesh-as-a-Service** — Developed automated 3D modeling concept using neural reconstruction. First-author paper was runner-up for Best Paper at I/ITSEC 2024 (Simulation subcommittee).
- **Flight Debrief Study** — Led strategic study on automated flight debriefing summarization. Published at ICCAS 2024.
- Supervised two Master's students on 3D reconstruction and drone path planning.

### Epidemic Forecasting (Volunteer)
**Frontend Developer** · 2020

Supported Covid-19 scenario modeling for decision makers, focused on the global south. Built model visualization in the frontend.
