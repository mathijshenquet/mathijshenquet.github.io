This is my personal blog, it is github pages but no Jekyll. The code for the
website (static HTML) simply lives in `docs/`

Prefer to never explore the codebase, I will attempt to give you sufficient 
context to solve a problem. Ask if things are unclear or if you want to do 
a codebase exploration.
